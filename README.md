## Post MVP

- Functionality for restricting each user to only be able to update or delete their own posts only.
- Functionality for restricting non-user to be able to read only first few lines of reports.
- Some experimental challenges on CSS for player report cards.
- Create a rank table that lists the most potential players based on ratings.
- Make a like button that may indicate the popularity of each player. 

## Code Showcase
 
  <!-- <div className="tab-container">
      <div className="bloc-tabs">
        <div className={toggleState === 1 ? "tab active-tab" : "tab"} onClick={() => toggleTab(1)}>Featured</div>
        <div className={toggleState === 2 ? "tab active-tab" : "tab"} onClick={() => toggleTab(2)}>All Players</div>
     
      </div>
      <div className="content-tabs">
        <div className={toggleState === 1 ? "content active-content" : "content"}>
        <FeaturedCard />
        </div>
        <div className={toggleState === 2 ? "content active-content" : "content"}>
        <Link id="sortLeague" to="/leagues/"><span id="sortSpan">Sort By Leagues</span></Link>
        {leagues?.map((league) => (
        <p key={league.id}>{league.name}</p>
      ))}
         {leagues?.map((league) => (
        <p key={league.id}>{league.name.players}</p>
      ))} -->

## Code Issues & Resolutions

I have been having a problem to access the league data which I made a join table to associate with each player.
